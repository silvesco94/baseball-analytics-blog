# Baseball Analytics Blog

This is a co-authored baseball analytics blog built with GitHub Pages.

## Purpose

A shared analytics-focused blog where each article is:

- A standalone GitHub repository
- Includes Python-based analysis (Colab or scripts)
- Static images and charts
- Linked or embedded code
- Lightweight, Git-backed publishing

## Structure

This central repository serves as the homepage and index:

- `index.md`: The home page of the blog â€” links to individual article repos and preview images
- `_config.yml`: Site settings for GitHub Pages (Jekyll)
- `assets/images/`: Contains preview images (thumbnails) for each article
