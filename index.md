## About Us

Ethan and Scott are two diehard sports fans and longtime friends with a shared passion for analytics, sarcasm, and deeply unnecessary debates about the games we love — baseball and beyond.

After countless hours arguing over clutch hitting, field goal percentage in the clutch, and whether playoff Jimmy Butler is a myth or a movement, we realized something:

It’s time to put the numbers where our mouths are.

This blog is our sandbox — a place to break down hot takes, challenge narratives, and apply cold, hard data to the wonderfully chaotic world of sports. Whether it’s validating a playoff legend, debunking a cursed closer, or running regression models on goat-tier receivers — we’re here for it.

Our mission is simple:

> **No more “just trust me.” Only: “trust me, here’s the data.”**

Expect Python-powered charts, absurd hypotheses, cross-sport comparisons, and the occasional statistical hill we’re fully prepared to die on. If it’s niche, nerdy, or just a little too deep — that’s exactly why we’re covering it.
